# pyopencl-tutorials

This repository contains a tutorial-like introduction of parallel programming in OpenCL using Andreas Kl√∂ckners PyOpenCL.
The project is split into tutorials and examples. 
Tutorial scripts are designed such that they highlight different aspects of parallel programming. 
Their code should animate to play around with OpenCL using simple data structures and processing ideas. 
In contrast the examples are closed, more complex applications that illustrate the interplay of openCL concepts.
